## Back-end programmer

Hello, I'm Vinicius, a professional in the field of programming, passionate about technology and innovation.

My career had its beginnings as a young apprentice at an engineering company known as Engematex. This work mainly consisted of performing tasks related to the Office suite and AutoCAD. I also had to take a course at Senai Nadir Dias de Figueiredo, where I had access to technical drawing classes that provided me with many advantages when it came to carrying out my work.

After these two years of apprenticeship, I graduated both from Senai and from high school. I pursued a technical high school diploma in data processing. At the beginning of 2019, I embarked on a one-year language exchange in the United States, where I learned a lot. In addition to improving my language skills and enhancing my conversational abilities, I gained a great deal of confidence in my communication. During this period, I also worked as an employee at the English school I was attending, as I am proficient in three languages: English, Spanish, and Portuguese.

Upon returning to Brazil in early 2020, I enrolled at Senai Mariano Ferraz College in the Industrial Learning course. I had already been exposed to programming languages during high school, which made me realize that I wanted to work in this field. Throughout these college years, I became increasingly interested in this area and took several courses, which I continue to pursue to this day. Alongside my studies, I began an internship at Murr Elektronik, where I worked as an internal salesperson. In this role, I was responsible for entering customer orders and addressing technical inquiries from companies.

Now, following the completion of my college studies and my contract with the company, I am actively seeking a position in the programming field, with a slightly stronger emphasis on Back-end development. Over the years of studying, including college, technical education, and the numerous courses I take regularly, I realize that this field aligns perfectly with my interests and skills.
